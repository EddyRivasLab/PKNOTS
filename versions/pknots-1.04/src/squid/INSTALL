Installation instructions for squid: SRE, Fri Jul 23 18:35:03 1993

1) Edit the top of the Makefile. 
   Set the paths and other make variables to suit your system.

2) type 'make' to build everything

3) type 'make install' to install everything

4) type 'make clean' to clean up.

The squid library is known to build cleanly on the following systems:
  Sun SPARCstations running SunOS 4.1.1 and Solaris 2.x
  SGIs running IRIX 4.0	and IRIX 5.x
  DEC Alphas running OSF/1 V3.x 	
  Intel PCs running Linux 1.2.x and 1.3.x

The code is ANSI-compliant wherever possible. It is intended that it
should build "out of the box" on any UNIX platform. If you attempt to
build it on a UNIX platform and it fails, report it to me as a bug.
If you attempt to build it on a non-UNIX platform and succeed, please
tell me what you needed to do. If you attempt to build it on a
non-UNIX platform and fail, please tell me what went wrong so I can
continue to improve portability.

It is currently maintained under SGI IRIX and under Linux.
